### About

Carimbo is a simple yet complete 2D game engine written in modern C++ using SDL. It is scriptable in Lua and was created during the spare time of [Rodrigo Delduca](https://rodrigodelduca.com.br/).

It is a spiritual successor to the [Wintermoon](https://github.com/wintermoon/wintermoon) framework, a project by the same author. It runs natively on Linux, Windows, macOS, and on the web (via WebAssembly), and it also supports mobile platforms, including Android & iOS.

### Name

_“Carimbo”_ comes from the Portuguese word for “stamp,” and that’s exactly what a 2D game engine does—it constantly stamps sprites onto the screen.

### Games

Games and demos created with the Carimbo engine are hosted on https://carimbo.run. They can be tested or played online without any installation, thanks to WebAssembly technology native to all modern browsers.
