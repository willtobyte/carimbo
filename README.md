### About

Carimbo is a simple yet complete 2D game engine written in modern C++ using SDL. It is scriptable in Lua and was created in [Rodrigo Delduca's](https://rodrigodelduca.com.br/) spare time.

It is a spiritual successor to the [Wintermoon](https://github.com/wintermoon/wintermoon) framework, a project by the same author. It runs natively on Linux, Windows, macOS, and on the web (via WebAssembly), and it also supports mobile platforms, including Android & iOS.

### Name

_"Carimbo"_ comes from the ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· word for "stamp," and that is exactly what a 2D game engine doesâ€”it constantly stamps sprites onto the screen.

### Motivation

During the summer of 2009, I attempted to port my SDL-based game engine to Googleâ€™s Native Clientâ€”a Chrome-specific technology and early precursor to WebAssembly. Low-level programming still courses through my veins, and now, with the universal reach of WebAssembly and a wealth of experience, Iâ€™m building my own game engine once again.

### Games

Games and demos created with the Carimbo engine are hosted on https://carimbo.run. They can be tested or played online without any installation, thanks to WebAssembly technology native to all modern browsers.

### License

A simple, permissive license that offers complete commercial freedomâ€”use, modify, and distribute your projects with ease. With minimal restrictions and a single attribution requirement. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

### Building
