### About

Carimbo is a simple yet complete 2D game engine written in modern C++ using SDL. It is scriptable in Lua and was created during [Rodrigo Delduca's](https://rodrigodelduca.org) spare time.

It is a spiritual successor to the [Wintermoon](https://github.com/wintermoon/wintermoon) framework, a project by the same author. It runs natively on Linux, Windows, macOS, and the web (via WebAssembly), and it also supports mobile platforms, including Android & iOS.

### Name

"Carimbo" comes from the ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· word for "stamp," and that is exactly what a 2D game engine doesâ€”it continuously stamps sprites onto the screen.

### Documentation

See [DOCUMENTATION](DOCUMENTATION.md).

### Games

Games and demos created with the Carimbo engine are hosted at [carimbo.games](https://carimbo.games). They can be tested or played online without installation, thanks to WebAssembly technology supported by all modern browsers.

### License

A simple, permissive license that offers complete commercial freedomâ€”use, modify, and distribute your projects with easeâ€”with minimal restrictions and a single attribution requirement. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

### Building

See [BUILDING](BUILDING.md).
