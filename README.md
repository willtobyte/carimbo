### About

Carimbo is a simple yet complete 2D game engine written in modern C++ using SDL. It is scriptable in Lua and was created in [Rodrigo Delduca's](https://rodrigodelduca.com.br/) spare time.

It is a spiritual successor to the [Wintermoon](https://github.com/wintermoon/wintermoon) framework, a project by the same author. It runs natively on Linux, Windows, macOS, and on the web (via WebAssembly), and it also supports mobile platforms, including Android & iOS.

### Name

_"Carimbo"_ comes from the 🇧🇷 word for "stamp," and that is exactly what a 2D game engine does—it constantly stamps sprites onto the screen.

### Motivation

In 2009, during an extended summer break, I attempted to port my SDL-based 2D game engine (Wintermoon) to Google’s Native Client (NaCl) in a shared student residence room. NaCl, Chrome’s sandbox for native code, can be seen as a precursor to WebAssembly. Although I eventually moved from game to web development, low-level programming still courses through my veins, fueling my dream of building a web-based game engine.

### Games

Games and demos created with the Carimbo engine are hosted on https://carimbo.run. They can be tested or played online without any installation, thanks to WebAssembly technology native to all modern browsers.

### License

A simple, permissive license that offers complete commercial freedom—use, modify, and distribute your projects with ease. With minimal restrictions and a single attribution requirement. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).
